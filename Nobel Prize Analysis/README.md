# Analysis of Nobel Laureates from 1901-present

On November 27, 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will in Paris. When it was opened after his death, the will caused a lot of controversy, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. Alfred Nobel dictates that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind”. Every year the Nobel Prize is given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.

Today we're going to analyse a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize. Let's see what patterns we can uncover in the past Nobel laureates and what can we learn about the Nobel prize and our world more generally.

**Data obtained from Kaggle**

This is a preliminary analysis of the dataset that addresses the following questions:

1. How many categories are there and how are they distributed?
2. How does females compare to male laureates?
3. What is the distribution of awards by country
4. What is the predominant age of the laureates?

<br>

## Results:

* There are six categories: Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, Peace, Literature and Economics. The field of Medicine had the highest number of awards given.
